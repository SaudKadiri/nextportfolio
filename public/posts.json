        "content": "The year started with me getting allocated to a project that made me fall in love with Java and DevOps (and Figma). Lost some of my time on wrong people but by the end everything came on track by giving up on them. The year taught me not every story needs to have a good ending, and perhaps I'm taking it forward with me forever. I also started with my passion for writing, turned out I'm more than just a code writer and quite a philosopher. The year ended with a good family picnic to Alibag beach, enjoyed it, good times. I wish I could have concentrated on Math and Projects a bit more (as well as content creation). Also spent a good time listening to music. Thanks TCS and Liquid for having me. 2025, thanks for coming, looking forward to what you have for me.",
